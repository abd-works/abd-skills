# Anchors

An **anchor** is a module. It is the most stable, central thing you have found in the domain — the concepts you are confident will survive the entire modeling process without being renamed or restructured away.

---

## What an anchor is

An anchor is three things at once:

1. **A module frame** — a named, dashed container in the diagram that groups related classes
2. **A core class** with the same name as the frame — the primary class in that module
3. **A scope boundary** — everything inside the frame belongs to this module; everything outside relates to it via its core class

The module name, frame title, and core class name must all match. If they don't, the anchor is not yet correctly identified.

---

## The anchor test

Before calling something an anchor, it must pass all three of these:

**1. Can you name a core class that matches the module?**
The core class must be identifiable by name in the source. You should be able to point to a section, definition, or keyword in the material that defines this concept by that name. A generic name like "Foundation," "Basics," or "Mechanics" with no corresponding defined concept is a signal you are grouping by proximity rather than identity — not a real anchor.

**2. Do other anchors reference it independently?**
If another module needs to point to this concept, does it reference this class by name — or does it go through some other class to get to it? If the only path to it goes through another anchor, it is likely a supporting class inside that anchor's module, not its own anchor.

> Example: HeroPoint has its own lifecycle and lifecycle rules, but nothing in the resolution system references HeroPoint directly — it is always accessed through the Character who holds it. HeroPoint belongs inside the Character module.
>
> Contrast: Check IS referenced directly — the entire game resolves outcomes through Check. No other anchor is needed to mediate access to it.

**3. Does it have structural stability?**
An anchor is a concept you expect to be present in the model from scan through final refinement. If you think it might disappear, merge with something else, or be renamed significantly, it is a candidate — not an anchor.

## What an anchor is NOT

- **A chapter in the source** — a chapter is an organization of the source, not a domain concept. Multiple real anchors can come from one chapter; one chapter alone does not make an anchor.
- **A concept with a dedicated section** — many things have dedicated sections. The anchor test is structural (other anchors reference it independently), not documentary.
- **A grouping of related concepts** — if you find 3–4 concepts that are related but none of them clearly dominates, keep exploring. The anchor will be the one that the others depend on. If none dominates, record the cluster as a tension.

## Anchor as module — what it looks like in outputs

| Output | What anchor produces |
|--------|---------------------|
| `domain-scan-results.md` | Row in the anchors table: Module name, core class name, scan-visible supporting classes, basis |
| `domain-scan-model.md` | Module section header + core class entry + supporting class entries with `[supporting class — ModuleName module]` annotation |
| `domain-scan-model.drawio` | One dashed frame per anchor; core class inside; supporting classes inside; cross-module relationships between core classes only |
| `term-registry.md` | Core class → `anchor` classification; supporting classes → `candidate` classification with Module? column naming their module |

## Anchors in later phases

Anchor status is not permanent. Anchors are your highest-confidence starting point, but subsequent phases will test and revise them:

- **nouns-verbs-rules-and-states (NOUNS):** All bolded and defined terms in the source are extracted. Anchors are not re-evaluated here, but new candidates emerge that may challenge or subdivide existing anchor boundaries.
- **candidate-list (CANDS):** Candidates are sorted and scored. At this stage, watch for candidates that score high enough on the anchor test to be promoted — or anchors whose core class fails the independence test and should be demoted.
- **thing-vs-data-about-a-thing (THINGS):** Supporting classes inside anchor frames are evaluated here — each gets a class/property decision. If a supporting class earns class status, it may eventually warrant its own module frame in later phases.
- **All subsequent phases:** Anchors drive the backbone of the model. Relationship decisions, responsibility assignments, and inheritance structures are all organized relative to anchor modules. Changes to anchor boundaries affect the whole model — flag them explicitly in the term registry before proceeding.

## Incomplete anchor signal

The absence of a matching core class is the clearest signal that you have not yet found the anchor. When you encounter this situation:

1. Do not force a name — generic names produce models that are hard to reason about
2. Read the relevant chapter(s) more carefully — the anchor often has its own defined term or dedicated section
3. Ask: if another module needed to reference this cluster, what single class would it name?
4. If no single class emerges after exploration, record the cluster as a **tension** in domain-scan-results.md and defer
