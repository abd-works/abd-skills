# Rules and scanners (base framework for every skill)

**Status:** **Normative default** for Open Agent Skills in this repo. When a skill defines **governance rules** (`rules/*.md`) and wants **machine enforcement**, wire checks this way—not as one-off phase script call-outs.

## What owns what

| Layer | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| **`rules/<stem>.md`** | The **human-readable rule**: scope, must/should, examples, done criteria. |
| **`rules/scanners.json`** | **Which script enforces which rule** — `rule_scanner_bindings[]` maps `rule_id` + `rule_file` → `scanner` path (relative to skill root). Optional top-level **`scanners`** lists scanner scripts for tooling that expects a flat array. |
| **`skill-config.json` → `operator.build_pipeline`** | **Ordered post-merge steps** that **`scripts/base/build.py`** runs after it writes **`AGENTS.md`** / **`content/built/`** (or your skill’s equivalent). Entries are typically **`scripts/...py`** paths: rule-bound scanners, emitters, manifest generators, rule-example linters, etc. **Empty or omitted** means “merge only” (skills with no automated checks yet). |
| **`skill-config.json` → `operator.scanners`** | **Operator / CI gate** — paths **`agentic-skill-builder`** **`operator.run_operator()`** runs **after** **`operator.build_script`**. **Keep these paths aligned** with the scanner steps you care about (usually the same modules listed in **`build_pipeline`** and/or **`rules/scanners.json`**), so “green build” and “green operator” mean the same checks. |

## What you do not do

- **Do not** treat **scanners** as **phase-owned scripts** in **`process.md`** process tables. Phase rows are for **human/AI procedure** and **merge / emit** entry points (e.g. `python scripts/base/build.py`), not for listing every validator. If readers need detail, add a short **“Rules and scanners”** subsection in **`process.md`** that points here and to **`rules/scanners.json`**.
- **Do not** bind scanners only in prose. If a rule is machine-checked, add a **`rule_scanner_bindings`** row and a **`build_pipeline`** step (and **`operator.scanners`** / Operator docs as required by your host).

## Execution flow (mental model)

1. Author edits **`content/parts/`**, **`rules/`**, **`skill-config.json`**.
2. **`python scripts/base/build.py`** merges instruction bundles, then runs **`operator.build_pipeline`** in order (if present).
3. **Operator** (or CI) runs compile check → **`build.py`** again → **`operator.scanners`** (when configured).

**Reference implementation:** **`abd-maps-models-specs`** — `rules/scanners.json`, **`operator.build_pipeline`** in **`skill-config.json`**, and **`scripts/base/build.py`** driving the pipeline after merge.

## Scaffolded skills

Greenfield trees from **`scaffold_skill.py`** should ship **`rules/scanners.json`** (even if bindings start empty) and a **`skill-config.json`** fragment that includes **`operator.build_pipeline`** alongside **`operator.scanners`**, so authors extend **one** pattern instead of inventing ad hoc wrappers.

See also: **[`Skill structure and concepts.md`](skill-structure-and-concepts.md#skill-structure-sec3)** (§3.1 config row), **[`builder-vs-operator.md`](builder-vs-operator.md)**, **`rules/README.md`** at the skill root.
