# Class Diagrams (Draw.io and Markdown)

## Templates — use these for every create/update

All class-structure work should **start from** or **stay aligned with** the checked-in templates under the skill **`templates/`** folder (paths relative to the skill root):

| Role | Template file | When to use it |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| **Draw.io** | `templates/domain model template.drawio` | **New diagram:** duplicate this file into the workspace, rename, then edit. **Existing diagram:** when adding classes or relationships, keep the same swimlane style, member layout, and collaborator-line conventions as the template. |
| **Markdown** | `templates/domain model template.md` | **New companion doc:** copy structure and headings from this file. **Updates:** when you change the `.drawio` or the `.md`, update the **other** artifact in the same pass and preserve the template’s patterns (classes, `opt` collaborators, `Invariant:` lines). |

Do **not** invent a one-off Markdown shape or Draw.io layout for class models unless the user explicitly opts out — the templates encode Jeff’s notation (collaborators on the second line in Draw.io, matching `opt` / invariants in Markdown).

**CLI:** New diagrams can be created with `scripts/drawio_cli.py`; even then, prefer matching the **visual and structural** conventions of `domain model template.drawio` (or duplicate the template and extend it) so `verify` / layout rules apply cleanly.

## What to keep in sync

When the user asks to **create or update** modeling diagrams:

| Artifact | Draw.io | Markdown companion |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Class structure** | `*.drawio` (see template above; CLI: `drawio_cli.py`) | Same structure and semantics as `templates/domain model template.md` |

**Rule:** If both files exist for a topic, **update both** in the same pass so comments and collaborator lists do not drift. If only one exists, create the missing companion **from the templates** unless the user opts out.

**Speech-to-text note:** “Vast diagram” or “Lost diagram” in informal notes usually means **class diagram**.

## Class diagram — parallel “comments”

Jeff’s style embeds **collaborators** (and optionally **invariants**) next to fields and methods:

- In **Draw.io**, that is the second line in the member cell (indented), as in **`templates/domain model template.drawio`**.
- In **Markdown**, use **`templates/domain model template.md`**: optional collaborators after `opt`, and `Invariant:` lines.

Keep the **same** collaborators and constraints in both places when maintaining dual files.

## Crucial Visual Layout Rules for Class Diagrams

- **Hierarchical Flow:** Superclasses/abstract classes must sit vertically above their subclasses.
- **Orthogonal Routing:** Use right-angled (stepped) routing for associations/compositions. Inheritance arrows must point straight up.
- **Anchor Points:** Lines must snap to the perimeter of class boxes. Never leave them floating or intersecting text.
- **Clear Intersections:** Actively rearrange boxes to minimize crossing lines. Keep labels at the immediate ends of connector lines, and bring text to the front (Z-order) so it isn't obscured.

## File naming (suggested)

| Pair | Example |
|------|---------|
| Class | `orders-model.drawio` + `orders-model.md` |

Shared stem makes sync obvious.
