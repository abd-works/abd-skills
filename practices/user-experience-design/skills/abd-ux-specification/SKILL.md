## Grill prompts

Read `common/grill-me-with-practice-skill.md` before grilling.

Before generating, surface these common input traps:

- **Stakeholder walk-through** — can a stakeholder actually walk through the happy path without explanation — or does this prototype require a developer standing next to them narrating what to click?
- **Stubbed vs real** — where does the prototype stop and the imagination begin — can stakeholders tell what's real behaviour and what's faked, or will they assume everything they see works?
- **Error and edge states** — what does the user see when something fails — a network error, invalid input, expired session — and are those states in the prototype or just in someone's head?
- **Visual decisions committed** — are the typography, colour, and spacing decisions in this prototype final or placeholder — will stakeholders approve something that changes after sign-off?
- **Flow completeness** — can the user complete every documented acceptance criterion end-to-end — or are there dead ends where the prototype just stops?
- **Fidelity expectations** — do stakeholders understand they're approving interaction and visual direction, not production code — or will they expect this to ship?

---

## Purpose

Turn approved lo-fi mockups into a clickable hi-fi prototype (real HTML/CSS/JS with design tokens) where navigation and state transitions are wired but backend logic stays stubbed — so stakeholders can walk flows, validate AC visually, and sign off before production begins.

## Output file

**Deliverables folder:** see `../common/skill-workflow.md` — Output file resolution.

**File names:**

| Artifact | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `<screen-slug>.html` (and linked `.css` / `.js` as needed) | Runnable clickable prototype — open in browser, no build required unless the host project already uses one for previews |
| `ux-specification.md` | Structured spec: source paths, **brand assets** (resolved or provisional), design carry-over, stub boundaries, AC → demonstrated behaviour map, and what is intentionally **not** implemented |
| `ux-specification.html` | Spec review page — embeds `prototype/index.html` (or `example/index.html`) in an `<iframe>`; link to the Markdown spec in the header |

Add a `<name>-` prefix only when disambiguation is needed. Default folder: `docs/ux/prototype/` (or the host project's UX prototype convention).

## Agent Instructions

Follow `../common/skill-workflow.md` — read-gates, output file resolution, and the per-rule verdict format are defined there.

### 1. Read context

Read these files:
- **`reference/concepts.md`** — what a clickable prototype is, carry-over from upstream, brand assets, stub vs real boundaries, accessibility at prototype fidelity, and the shape of a good prototype package.
- **`reference/brand-assets-questionnaire.md`** — key questions to ask when brand assets are missing or incomplete.

### 2. Generate

**Produce:**

| Output | What to produce |
| --- | --- |
| `ux-specification.md` | Screen name, source paths (IA, lo-fi, hi-fi/design refs), **brand assets brief** (`templates/brand-assets-brief.md`), design tokens used, region → element map, **stub catalogue** (what is faked and how), AC → click/demo path |
| Prototype files | Self-contained or host-folder HTML/CSS/JS that renders the screen and wires primary flows |
| `ux-specification.html` | When prototype folder contains `index.html`, copy `templates/ux-specification.html`, set `{{PROTOTYPE_INDEX}}` to the relative path (default `prototype/index.html`), iframe that entry |

**Generation flow:**

1. **Resolve inputs** — lo-fi path, AC file, domain language, screen name, design reference (tokens, brand CSS, or hi-fi export). Confirm where prototypes live in the host project.
2. **Resolve brand assets** — search the host project for guidelines, logos, and tokens. If anything is missing, run section 2 of `reference/brand-assets-questionnaire.md` using the **`AskQuestion` tool** (steps A–F) — do not paste the questionnaire as chat text. Record answers in the **Brand assets** section of `ux-specification.md` (`templates/brand-assets-brief.md`). Do not proceed to hi-fi styling until `AskQuestion` responses are received or the user approves provisional stand-ins.
3. **Carry over upstream decisions** — regions, affordances, labels, copy, typography roles, colour roles, density, and spacing from lo-fi and design reference. Do not invent new vocabulary or affordances.
4. **Author `ux-specification.md` first** — brand assets brief, then the stub catalogue: list every behaviour that is simulated (fake API JSON, `setTimeout` loading, toggled CSS classes for states, `localStorage` only if the demo requires it).
5. **Build the visual layer** — semantic HTML, real CSS (project tokens or documented stand-ins), logo and imagery from resolved assets, component structure that mirrors how production will eventually be organized without pulling in full app infrastructure.
6. **Wire interactions** — links, buttons, tabs, modals, and form submits navigate or swap visible states. Use minimal JavaScript: event handlers, DOM class toggles, template literals for fake responses. **Do not** integrate real APIs, databases, or domain services.
7. **Demonstrate AC paths** — each AC clause maps to a click path or visible state a reviewer can trigger manually; document the path in `ux-specification.md`. Happy paths first; edge/error states via stubbed responses or pre-seeded demo data.
8. **Mark prototype boundaries** — comment or document anything that looks real but is fake (`// PROTOTYPE: stub`). No silent pretence that stubbed behaviour is production-ready.
9. **Basic accessibility** — programmatic labels on inputs, keyboard-reachable controls, visible focus, text labels (not colour-only state). Full test suites and performance budgets are **out of scope** for this skill.
10. **Author `ux-specification.html`** — when an `example/` or `prototype/` folder contains `index.html`, generate the HTML spec page from `templates/ux-specification.html` with iframe `src` pointing at that index (relative path). List both spec files in `ux-specification.md` metadata.
11. **Verify in browser** — open `ux-specification.html` (or `prototype/index.html`), walk every documented AC path, confirm labels match UL/AC verbatim; confirm logo, colours, and imagery match the brand assets brief.

### 3. Validate

Run scanners and emit per-rule verdicts — see `../common/skill-workflow.md` § Validate output.

## Validate

**Goal:** Click through the prototype and read `ux-specification.md` as reviewers.

- **Upstream fidelity** — every region, affordance, and label from lo-fi and design reference appears in the prototype with the same wording.
- **Looks real** — typography, colour, spacing, logo, imagery, and components read as hi-fi, not grey-box wireframe.
- **Brand assets resolved** — existing host brand files used, or key questions asked and answers recorded; provisional stand-ins documented in **Brand assets**.
- **Clicks work** — primary flows and state changes are navigable without developer explanation.
- **Logic is honestly stubbed** — `ux-specification.md` lists fakes; no hidden dependency on production services.
- **AC demonstration map** — every acceptance criterion has a documented click path or seeded state; gaps are called out explicitly.
- **Not production** — no requirement for lint gates, unit tests per AC, or full domain implementation; those belong to downstream engineering skills.
- **Cross-artifact parity** — `ux-specification.md` and the prototype describe the same demo.
- **No bundle markers** — `SKILL.md` has no `<!-- execute_rules:bundle_rules -->` markers.
